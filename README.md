| resnet18.ipynb       | This is our initial attempt to create a working script which trains a ResNet 18 Torch model on our data. |
| Task1Final.ipynb     | In this code, we compared the results obtained by setting the pretrained toggle on and off.            |
| Hyperparametertuning.ipynb | Here we attempted to train our model with different hyperparameter values to see how it affects our previous results. |
